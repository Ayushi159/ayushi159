Hi, I am Ayushi Mishra, a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science And Engineering Department at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). I completed my B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, Gorakhpur, in 2019. Before joining my Ph.D. in the CSE Department, I worked as a Software Developer at HummingWave Technologies, a startup based in Bangalore, where I worked on Angular and React.js technologies.
